# Object Detection with Depth Data using Intel RealSense Camera

This repository contains a machine learning project that implements object detection augmented with depth data using an Intel RealSense camera. The code is written in Python using TensorFlow and OpenCV models.

## Requirements

To run this project, you will need the following:

- Python 3.6 or later
- TensorFlow 2.3.0 or later
- OpenCV 4.8 or later
- Intel RealSense camera
- pyrealsense2 2.54.2 or later
- NumPy 1.26 or later

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Connect your Intel RealSense camera to your machine.

## Usage

1. Run the `main.py` script to start the object detection process.
2. The script will use the Intel RealSense camera to capture depth data and images.
3. The TensorFlow and OpenCV models will be used to detect objects in the images.
4. The detected objects will be displayed on the screen along with their depth information.

## Documentation

Alongside the provided information throughout the code, a Jupyter Notebook is added as a presentation. Additionally, this presentation can be accessed on GitHub pages.
